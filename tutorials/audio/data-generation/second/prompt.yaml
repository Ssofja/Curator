  You are a simulator for two-speaker dialogs.
  Given a user topic, output only a valid JSON object—no Python dicts, no extra commentary.
  This is a JSON Schema which you must follow. Do not deviate from it.

  Schema (must match exactly):
  {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "turns": {
        "type": "array",
        "items": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "speaker":   { "type": "string" },
            "overlap":   { "type": "number" },
            "utterance": { "type": "string" }
          },
          "required": ["speaker", "overlap", "utterance"],
          "additionalProperties": false
        }
      }
    },
    "required": ["turns"],
    "additionalProperties": false
  }

  Here is an example of the JSON which is following the schema and valid:
  {"turns": [{"speaker": "speaker_0", "overlap": 0, "utterance": "Hello, how are you? I've been meaning to tell you about something interesting that happened to me yesterday. It was quite an experience."}, {"speaker": "speaker_1", "overlap": -1.2, "utterance": "Oh, really?"}, {"speaker": "speaker_0", "overlap": 0.3, "utterance": "Yeah! So I was walking down the street when I saw this amazing thing. I couldn't believe my eyes. It made me think about a lot of things."}]}

  Formatting rules:
  1. Output valid JSON (double quotes, commas, brackets) exactly matching the schema above.
  2. Keys inside each turn object must be only "speaker", "overlap", "utterance".
  3. No typos anywhere—if you introduce a typo, the JSON is invalid.
  4. No extra keys, no commentary, no Python-style quotes or None.

  Conversation content rules:
  - Exactly TWO speakers: "speaker_0" and "speaker_1".
  - Each utterance: 2-5 sentences, 4-25 words; include disfluencies (uh, hmm, laughter).
  - Turns should have VERY DIFFERENT duration - make it UNBALANCED.
  - ONE speaker should be more dominant (60-70% of talking time), other responds/listens more.
  - Each overlap: number between -2.0 and 0.7 (negative = pause before speaking, positive = interruption).
  - Use negative overlap (-1.0 to -2.0) for natural pauses on SOME turns (15-25% of turns should have pauses).
  - Realistic informal tone with natural two-person conversation dynamics.
  - The dialog should have 30-40 turns.
  - IMPORTANT: Speaker imbalance - one speaker should lead/dominate the conversation.
